       <h2>Category » Custom Quest Editor Questions</h2>
	   
	    <spoiler title="What is the Custom Quest Editor?">
	    The Custom Quest Editor (aka CQE) is a free pc application that permit you to create and play custom quests for MHP3rd.
	    </spoiler>
	   
        <spoiler title="What are the CQE requirements?">
		If you are using Windows, you need to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank">.NET Framework 4.0</a> on your machine. It's obviously free.<br/>
		The application is compatible with <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">Mono</a> too, so you can execute it on Linux and Mac too.
	    </spoiler>
	   
	    <spoiler title="What are the Console requirements?">
		There are three ways to use the quests generated with the CQE:<br/>
		1) Install them downloading them directly from the game through the QS3 Store (You need a Wifi connection, refer to the "Store" FAQs)<br/>
		2) Having a PSP with a Custom Firmware installed and a plugin called "FreeCheat" (You can find it in the "Download" section)<br/>
		3) Insert them into the game using the CQE (This function is not implemented yet)<br/><br/>
		If you lack those requirements you can't use the Custom Quests on your PSP/PS3.
		</spoiler>
		
		<spoiler title="Can I play my custom quests in multiplayer?">
		Yes you can, even if your friends don't have them on the console.<br/>
		Of course there are some special quests that have some limitations (like "Single Player Quests", "Max 2 Player" etc).<br/>
		The game will automatically share the quests when trying to playing it with your friends. Don't worry, them won't be saved anywhere.<br/>
		Hoewer, there are different methods to play custom quests in multiplayer, please refer to the FAQ according to the method you are using to launch them.
		</spoiler>
		
		<spoiler title="Can I use them on 'Xlink Kai' or 'adHoc Party' too?">
		Of course. But ask to all player in the room before starting a Custom Quest, not everyone likes them.

		<h3>Simple Tutorials</h3><hr/>

		<spoiler title="First time execution">
		The first time you execute the CQE you will see a Configuration Wizard. Choose your preferred language to start using the CQE.<br/>
		If your language isn't in the list, try to download it from "Search Languages" menu.<br/>
		The advanced CQE Options aren't configured by the Wizard, try to check the "Options" menu while using it.
		</spoiler>
		
		<spoiler title="Download and Install a Language">
		You can do it through the Configuration Wizard clicking on "Search Languages" or from the menu 'Options > Download Languages'.<br/>
		The application must communicate with the server, so it can take a while.<br/>
		Just click on the languages you want to download (you can downlaod multiple languages at the same time), then click on "Download".
		</spoiler>
		
		<spoiler title="Update the application and the Language Packs">
		If you don't have checked the Option 'Auto-Check for Updates' wich search if an update is available each time you open the CQE, you can do it manually clicking on the menu 'Options > Check for Updates'.<br/>
		While updating, also all the installed Language Packs will be updated (if an updated Language Pack is available).<br/>
		Is it possible that some language packs won't be supported by the CQE because of the update, hoewer, the program will promt you wich one will not work.<br/>
		You can manually search for language updates clicking on the menu 'Options > Downlaod Languages'.<br/>
		This utility shows you all the available languages for the current CQE version at the moment.<br/>
		Consider that the CQE is always updated and some Language Packs aren't instantly updated so just wait for an update (You will see an announcement on the QS3 site), or try to upgrade/fix the Language Pack on your own (all necessary info are inserted in this site).<br/>
		You can become a QS3 collaborator as Official Language Pack Translator.
		</spoiler>

		<spoiler title="Create a new Quest">
		Open the CQE, then click on 'File > New' and choose what map you want to use.<br/>
		Some maps are in the submenues "High Rank" and "Low Rank" too.<br/>
		You cannot change the map after you've chosen it, you had to make a new Quest.
		</spoiler>

		<spoiler title="Differences between "Low Rank" maps and "High Rank" maps">
		While playing in the game, you will notice that the quests are organized in "Low Rank" quests and "High Rank" quests.<br/>
		The Rank repesents the quest difficulty and you can't find certains items in "Low Rank" missions.<br/>
		In other words, you can't insert rare items in "Low Rank" missions. Hoewer, the quest difficulty can be changed anytime changing the mission "Level".
		</spoiler>

		<h3>Advanced Tutorials</h3><hr/>

		<spoiler title="Re-Execute the Configuration Wizard">

		</spoiler>
		<spoiler title="Install Language Packs manually">
